The package com.thesecretserver.service contains only code generated by the following steps:

- check version. The version of the Secret Server running at the British Library at the time
of this writing was 8.8.000020.

https://blsps.ad.bl.uk/secretserver/webservices/sswebservice.asmx/VersionGet

- download sswebservice.asmx

https://blsps.ad.bl.uk/secretserver/webservices/sswebservice.asmx?WSDL

- remove this node from sswebservice.asmx (it would cause an error on wsimport)

    <s:schema targetNamespace="urn:thesecretserver.com/AbstractTypes">
      <s:import namespace="http://schemas.xmlsoap.org/soap/encoding/" />
      <s:complexType name="StringArray">
        ...
      </s:complexType>
    </s:schema>

- remove all nodes which refer to StringArray. That shouldn't cause any problems, because
they are not needed for SOAP, but only for alternative HTTP GET and POST requests.

<wsdl:part name="..." type="s1:StringArray" />

- generate sources

wsimport -keep -p com.thesecretserver.service -wsdllocation https://blsps.ad.bl.uk/secretserver/webservices/sswebservice.asmx sswebservice.asmx


Regenerating the service stubbs.

e.g. 

    curl -O "https://blsps.ad.bl.uk/secretserver/webservices/sswebservice.asmx/VersionGet"
    curl -o sswebservice.asmx "https://blsps.ad.bl.uk/secretserver/webservices/sswebservice.asmx?WSDL"

Then edited out the soap import (didn't seem to need to remove the StringArray references under JDK 8), then, in the `app` folder.

    rm -fr com/thesecretserver/service
    /cygdrive/c/Program\ Files/Java/jdk1.8.0_65/bin/wsimport  -keep -p com.thesecretserver.service -wsdllocation https://blsps.ad.bl.uk/secretserver/webservices/sswebservice.asmx sswebservice.asmx

Note that these stubs indicate there is a HTTP REST API, which might be a better integration idea.
